		<h1>The Heart of Nashville, Tennessee</h1>
		<p>Nashville is a vibrant city with culture, country music and artistry around every corner. There is an activity many tourists take-part in when visiting Nashville. There are beautifully painted murals across the city, where you can go and take neat photos with. This is just one of the many murals we visited in the scorching August heat of Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

		 <h1>Our first Tattoos</h1>
		 <p> Since this was a best friends trip, we decided to get our first tattoos together. We researched for a while, and settled on this tattoo studio, Hart and Huntington. My tattoo artist's name was Angel, he is originally from Venezuela, and moved to Nashille with this family three years ago. He as been a tattoo artist for 15 years, and does exquisite, realistic pieces. I settled on a small, simple unalome on my forearm for my first tattoo, but in the future, I would love a detailed tattoo designed by Angel.</p>

		<h1>Cummins Falls State Park</h1>
		<p>This is a must see road trip the next time you are in Nashville. This park is about one hour outside Nasville and is a change of scenery from the big city. If you love hiking and nature, you will fall in love with this place. The hike is moderate with uneven terrain (large rocks and uphills) and takes about an hour one way. We began our hike at 9:00am, to beat the August heat and returned to our car at 12:30pm. The refreshing swim in the falls was a much deserved reward.</p>
