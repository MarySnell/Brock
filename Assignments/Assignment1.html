<h4>Vanity Makeover</h4>
<p>
<a href="#creativity"> anchor here </a>

I had been staring at the same vanity for 5 years and constantly thinking to myself “I really hate that thing…” (Okay, hate is a strong word, but it definitely was not my style) although, did have some benefits. This one fit in the space perfectly, it had lots of storage and purchasing a whole new vanity can be very expensive (especially for the ones I like). So, I decided to make it my next DIY project!
One icy winter morning in February, it turned out to be a snow day at the college, so I had the day off with the kids (whoo hoo!) I got the idea to drive to Home Depot and buy some paint to give this vanity a facelift! This is what we started with…
</p>
<p>
For me, it just lacked personality and an individual style. I began by removing the hardware, sanding down the surfaces to be painted and placing painter’s tape along the walls and the floor of the vanity (I am a very messy painter). I then proceeded to prime the surfaces prior to painting. I do not always prime my items, but with this material, I’d rather be safe than sorry.
</p>
<p>
Once the primer set for 1 hour or so, I finally got to paint! The prep is always the most tedious part. I did not remove the drawers or doors because I am planning on covering the inside of the vanity with wallpaper very soon. If you were looking for a clean, mistake free job, I would advise you to remove all of these items and paint them separately.
I used <em>Behr Premium Plus interior paint</em> in the shade Grey Whale in a satin finish. I love the look of this finish (not too matte) and it is also very durable and easy to clean. After I applied the first coat, I found the colour to be patchy and streaky. Once I let that coat dry for about an hour and put on a second coat, the colour was turning out beautiful! I applied a total of 3 coats (tuned into 4, but more on that later..) to obtain a fully opaque outcome.
</p>
<p>
For the last step of the painting process, I used a small paintbrush to touch-up and areas around the walls and floor. I also used it in some difficult-to-reach nooks and crannies to ensure all areas were well painted. As you can see, I managed to get paint all over myself, I warned you I was a messy painter!
I allowed the paint to dry for two days and then employed my (ah-hum) handy husband to install the new hardware. I found these handles on Amazon for a fraction of the price at Home Depot. They are great quality with a beautiful nickel finish.
</p>
<p>
And voila! The vanity is freshly painted and gives a completely new, modern and fresh look to our washroom! Next steps… painting the walls a beautiful, fresh white and installing a new counter top, mirror and sink! IKEA, I think you just became my new best friend…
This mirror I think, is my favourite part of this whole project! What woman does not love a gigantic mirror to get ready in?! The sink and faucet I also love, we chose a bit of a smaller diameter for the sink to maximize our counter space. The marble white laminate counter top, we bought as a slap from IKEA and cut it according to the size we needed. We used the same counter top in the kitchen (new post soon!) We also cut out a space for the sink and faucet, the instructions that came with these items were actually quite useful. This product is a great, budget friendly alternative to marble or granite and is very easy to maintain.
</p>
<p>
You may notice, the blue colour of the vanity is different than the photos above. After painting the walls white, I touched up some blue spots, but the paint colour dried lighter (perhaps I did not mix it well enough) The funny thing is, I actually prefer this colour over the original. Isn’t funny how the universe can unexplainably act in your favour?
Of course, my favourite part of any DIY project is the styling the finished project. I bought the accessories from Home Sense, which is one of my all time favourite stores for discounted, yet modern home decor. Candles are my favourite accessory during a bath, and the pop of yellow gives the space a cozy, chic cottage feel.
</p>
<p>
This is how easy it is to turn something that does not fit your style, into something you admire, without the expensive price tag. Inspiration can go a long way and I hope my DIY vanity project sparked a little creativity in you!
