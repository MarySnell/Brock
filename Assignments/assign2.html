    <p>If you're like me, you are <span class="uppercase">obsessed </span> with chocolate, but when you are trying to stick to a healthy lifestyle, chocolate does not always fit. I adapted this dark chocolate + coconut recipe from Pinterest and fell in love at first bite!
    </p>
    <p> Our family was away on vacation for two weeks in June and we definitely fell off of the healthy life style bandwagon. Eating out frequently, constantly snacking on chips, popcorn etc. and we continued these habits when we returned home into the month of July. My body is now telling me that it needs to return to a healthy lifestyle and so I intend to listen.
    </p> These dark chocolate coconut cups curve my evening cravings for chocolate and sugar. They require no baking, just freezing each layer for 10 minutes or so prior to adding the next layer of perfection. 
    <p>As I have got older, I am drawn much more toward dark chocolate than milk or white chocolate, I suppose there are some benefits to the aging process! Check out all of the health benefits of dark chocolate and coconut below!

    <p> Now for the centre...coconut butter has been my new found love lately. It is so easy to throw into smoothies, or add to my bulletproof matcha tea latte for something different. Coconut butter is straight up pureed coconut and it is strong if you eat it right out of the jar, but paired with this dark chocolate, it is absolutely divine!

      <h4> Dark Chocolate Coconut Cups </h4>
      <h5>Recipe (makes 6 chocolate cups)</h5>
      <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>16oz of dark chocolate (70% or higher)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp of coconut oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of coconut butter (I used this one)</li>
      <li>Muffin cup liners</li>
    </ul>
  <a name="Recipe"/>

    <h5> Directions</h5>
    <div class="nest">
    <p> Using a double boiler or microwave, melt the dark chocolate with the coconut oil. While the chocolate and coconut oil do their thing, line a muffin try with your liners (mini ones would be really cute too!)
    </p>
   </div>
    <p> Once melted, spoon a thin later of chocolate in the bottom of each cup liner (I used 1 1/2 Tbsp for my size of cup). 
    </p>
    <p> Place tray in freezer to set for 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="nest p"> While this layer is freezing, melt your coconut butter over a double boiler. It will not turn really liquidy, (that's definitely not a word) but when you place it on top of your first layer of chocolate, it will lay perfectly, trust me. 
    </p>
    <p> Once your coconut butter is nice and warm, and your first layer of chocolate is firm, spoon a thin layer of the coconut butter into your cups. Then, place the tray back into the freezer to set (10-15 mins).
    </p>
    <p> Once set, spoon your last thin layer of dark chocolate on top of each cup to cover the coconut butter (again 1 1/2 Tbsp or so). Again, allow this layer is set in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.
    </p> 
    <p> I store my cups in a container in the freezer. You do need to allow them to sit a room temperature for a bit prior to eating them or you may break a tooth! They are the perfect little snack when craving something sweet and chocolatey!
    </p>
      <p>Enjoy!
